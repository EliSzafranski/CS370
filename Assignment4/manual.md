# TipCalculator Manual 

Hello and welcome to TipCalculator.
To use:
- Enter the total bill next to ```Check ammount```
- Enter the the number of people splitting the check next to ```Party size```
- Tap the ```COMPUTE TIP``` button



Next to ```Tip```, you will then see how much the tip is per person when the tip is 15%, 20%, and 25%

Below that, next to ```Total```, you will see how much each person owes, including tip, for the aforementioned three tip values.

***Note:*** *All values are rounded to the nearest whole dollar*
